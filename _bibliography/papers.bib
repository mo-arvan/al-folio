  abstract  = {The reproducibility of NLP research has drawn increased attention over the last few years. Several tools, guidelines, and metrics have been introduced to address concerns in regard to this problem; however, much work still remains to ensure widespread adoption of effective reproducibility standards. In this work, we review the reproducibility of Exploring Neural Text Simplification Models by Nisioi et al. (2017), evaluating it from three main aspects: data, software artifacts, and automatic evaluations. We discuss the challenges and issues we faced during this process. Furthermore, we explore the adequacy of current reproducibility standards. Our code, trained models, and a docker container of the environment used for training and evaluation are made publicly available.}

Ensuring the reproducibility of these evaluations is vital for maintaining credibility in natural language processing research. This paper presents our reproduction of the human evaluation experiments conducted by Hosking et al. (2022) for their paraphrase generation approach. Through careful replication we found that our results closely align with those in the original study, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.}
