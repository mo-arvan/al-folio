<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I'm Mo. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where I was mentored by [Dr. Natalie Parde](https://www.natalieparde.com/index.html). My research encompasses various areas within artificial intelligence such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

I am particularly committed to improving the evaluation and reproducibility of machine learning models. I am an advocate for Open Science, promoting transparency, equity, and inclusivity in research methodologies. I believe in the power of AI to serve the common good and enjoy solving complex problems with effective solutions.

Additionally, I have a keen interest in the intersection of AI and healthcare. This includes working on developing machine learning models to identify high-risk cancer patients and innovating AI-based tools for the early detection of diseases. My aim is to enhance healthcare delivery and improve patient outcomes through the application of artificial intelligence.
