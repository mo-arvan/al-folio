 I primarily focus on the evaluation and reproducibility of machine learning and natural language processing solutions. Aside from that, I enjoy working on problems involving accelerated computing, software design of ML models, and the efficiency of neural networks. I am working under supervision of [Dr. Natalie Parde](https://www.natalieparde.com/index.html).
