<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hey there! I'm Mohammad Arvan, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, under the supervision of [Dr. Natalie Parde](https://www.natalieparde.com/index.html). My research is centered on improving the reliability of machine learning, with a particular focus on evaluation and reproducibility. I advocate for Open Science, emphasizing transparency, equity, and inclusivity in research practices. With a strong engineering background, I prioritize practical solutions to enhance the trustworthiness of machine learning technologies.
