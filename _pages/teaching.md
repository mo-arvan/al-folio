I have worked as TA on the several entry and advanced courses in the department of computer science at UIC. I am genuinely passionate about helping others and always try my best to help students understand the concept. 

- Program Design II (Fall 18, Spring 19)
- Computer Algorithms (Fall 19, Spring 20)
- Programming Practicum (Fall 20, Spring 21)

Below are a few *selected* TA reviews that I have received as TA. 

> Mohammed always came to class prepared and always knew how to explain the code through different means. Whether it was through drawing or English. He was straight forward to the point and strict but he always means well towards his peers and helps them to build a better foundation on their programming skills in the long-run.

> Very helpful, especially on Piazza. Was always the first to answer questions and really helped students understand concepts better.

> Mohammad was by far the best TA I've ever had. He was always extremely helpful and patient during class, and his explanations were thorough. I really felt he wanted us to understand the material, and took the time to explain things in a way that made sense and stuck. Outside of class he was always VERY responsive to email and sometimes even addressed issues that may or may not have been his responsibility, but that I had questions/concerns about. It is because of him that Piazza was such an excellent resource for students, as he was not only quick to respond but again, he was also thorough in his explanations. He would even check individual students' code inside Codio to help that student figure out WHY they were struggling. When the strike was happening, we REALLY noticed the difference in how we were progressing in the course and the help we were receiving. In every sense, Mohammad really went above and beyond in his job as a Teaching Assistant. 

> Mohammad Arvan is great at explaining things in the lab if we are struggling. He was able to answer to questions in the simplest way possible.

> You were very welcoming and built a warm welcoming environment that made it feel comfortable to ask questions.
