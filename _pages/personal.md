Random fun facts about me: 
- I go by Mo.
- I ran 2021 Chicago Marathon as a [St. Jude Hero](http://heroes.stjude.org/arvan)!
- I was born in [Esfahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan), Iran. 
- There are more than 16 ways to pronounce my last name in Farsi/Persian. This was a lot of growing up!
- According to largest Persian dictionary, [Dehkhoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehkhoda_Dictionary), my last name means good virtue or quality.

<!-- AA as in "odd (AA.D)" ; R as in "race (R.EY.S)" ; V as in "vow (V.AW)" ; AE as in "at (AE.T)" ; N as in "knee (N.IY)" ; -->
<!-- My last name in persian is written as "آرون", the first letter, 'آ' (a) is similar to i in english where some times the dot is dropped, it is possible to drop the tilde from it, then you will end up with "ارون". Now, that might not seem that big of a deal, but since a, e, o, aa could be written with the letter 'ا', and the third letter could be read as va, ve, vo, or it could be dropped completely and be read as o, you will end up with 16 different combinations.  -->

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
